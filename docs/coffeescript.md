# Using CoffeeScript With Cake
There Are 2 Ways:
## Online(Codepen,JSFiddle)
1. Open Codepen Or JSFiddle(Your Choice)
2. In HTML Code Tab,Add One Of These 2 Lines:
```html
<!-- Unminimifed -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Rabios/Cake/build/cake.js"></script>
<!-- Minimifed -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Rabios/Cake/build/cake.min.js"></script>
```
3. Go To JavaScript Code Tab Options
4. Change Scripting Language To CoffeeScript Instead Of JavaScript
5. In JavaScript Code Tab(With Scripting Is In CoffeeScript),Add This Code:
```coffeescript
CreateCanvas WindowWidth,WindowHeight
Initialize()
SetDrawingMode "fill"
SetFont "40px arial"
DrawText CanvasWidth,CanvasHeight,"Hello World!!!","black",u,"center"
```
6. Run Code(If It Does Not Run Automatically)
## Offline
1. Download Cake Game Framework/Engine [Here](https://github.com/Rabios/Cake/archive/master.zip)
2. Download And Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
3. Open Command Prompt And Type This Command:
```
npm install coffeescript
```
Or:
```
npm install -g coffeescript
```
4. Create A Game Script And It's Name For Example `game.coffee`
5. Type Your CoffeeScript Code,You Can Use This Code As A Starter Template:
```coffeescript
CreateCanvas WindowWidth,WindowHeight
Initialize()
SetDrawingMode "fill"
SetFont "40px arial"
DrawText CanvasWidth,CanvasHeight,"Hello World!!!","black",u,"center"
```
6. Compile The Game Script Using The Following Command:
```
coffee -c -b game.coffee
```
7. Cause The Script Name Is `game.coffee`,A JavaScript File Would Be Generated By CoffeeScript With Name `game.js`
8. Create HTML File For Example With This Content:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title>Hello Coffee</title></head>
<body></body>
<script src="cake.js"></script>
<script src="game.js"></script>
</html>
