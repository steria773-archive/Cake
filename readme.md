# Cake
A HTML5 Game Framework/Engine To Make HTMl5 Games Rapidly!!!

> This Readme Is Needed To Be Completed!!!

## Features

### Graphics
- CanvasRenderingContext2D
  - Functions Made For Drawing Graphics Easily
  - Collections Of Filters Applying Functions To Style Game Content
  - Collections Of Game GUIs To Extend Game Content
  - Ability To Switch Context Or Canvas That CanvasRenderingContext2D Or WebGL Is Drawing On
  - Ability To Control Canvas(Resizing,Destroying,Hiding,Showing)
  - Ability To Take Screenshots(PC Browsers)
  - A 3D System Called Space To Make 3D Polygons And Shapes With 2D Graphics
- WebGL
  - Built On The Top Of `lightgl.js`
  - A Customized Version Coming Soon(Made From Pure WebGL)

### Physics
- A Lightweight Physics Engine Based On Collision Detection(Size Of 4kb)
- Physics(Collision Detection) Not Limited Only To Game Objects(Components) But Also For Shapes That Is Drawn

### Input
- Event Creation Made Easy
- Keyboard: Using Event Listeners Or `mousetrap.js`
- Gamepad: Using Event Listeners Or `gamepad.js`

### Audio
- Powered By WebAudio API
- A Component `Music()` For Playing,Pausing,Resuming Playing Sounds 

### Detection
- Detecting Made For:
1. Device Operating System Detection
2. Browser Features Detection
3. Native Features Detection

> Also,It Can Detect Many Other Things

### Customization
Most Of Cake Game Framework/Engine Functions Written As Variables With Arrow Function Values,Allowing It To Be Modified In-Game Or Web Console Or From Code

### Scripting(Game Programming)
- Coding The Game Can Be In JavaScript Or CoffeeScript Or LiveScript Or TypeScript
- Also You Can Use Any Language But You Need To Find A Way To Compile That Language's Code To JavaScript
- You Can Call Native Code (From Device) With It's Default Compiler(Python,Ruby, Or Any)
- Scripting Languages Tested On Cake Game Framework/Engine:
1. JavaScript 
2. CoffeeScript
3. LiveScript
4. TypeScript
5. ColaScript
6. ToffeeScript
7. Python(Via Transcrypt)
8. JS++

> Formula Here Is: Programming Language -> Compiled To/Is JavaScript Code + `cake.js` = Web Game

> NOTE: This Does Not Means That Other Than These Languages Won't Work!!!

## Showcase
Cake Can Be Used For Huge HTML5 Games,Altough There Is Some Simple Games And Examples Developed And Made By The Same Framework/Engine Developer

2. More New Examples And Features
3. New Tests For Other Programming Languages
4. More Bug Fixes
5. Adding Events To Components
6. Adding Cheatsheets And Full Manual
7. Adding Tools To Framework/Engine

> If I Had Freetime,More Examples Come Soon!!!
